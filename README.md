# AudioJoin
Join Audiobook tracks into one automatically


Skip importing files into audacity and organizing them qucikly in the correct order. 
This script will automatically organize tracks and join them. 
You will be asked to enter meta data. 
Files are exported as mp3 @ 64kbps by default. - I use it for audiobooks mainly but this can be changed easily by editing the script. 

Update: Added scripts to convert formats. Added windows portable executables.  

Update: I was unable to add a step to embed image that seemed to work in this script, I have added an optional file 'EmbedJpgMp3AlbumArtv2.py' if you want to add album art, this also allows you to only run EmbedJpgMp3AlbumArtv2.py if you have no audio to join.
